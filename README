 pkgtools
==========

simple package management tools written in ksh that is intended to be used in
linux systems. pkgtools offers a number of shell scripts that can be used to
create/add/remove/query a package. pkgtools is heavily inspired by pkgutils from
CRUX however pkgtools aims to be much simpler than pkgutils and has a "better"
dependency handling.

 database
==========

pkgtools' database is purely file based. each package has its own directory
which has information about the package in separate files.
`version-release`, `name`, `contents`, `owner`, `dependencies` are the major
files in a package's entry. `owner` is the person who built the package and
others should be self explanatory.

 pkgmk
=======

pkgmk is used to create a package. a pkgfile is simply a ksh script that is
sourced by pkgmk. the build function in the pkgfile is executed after checking
for some necessary variables in the pkgfile (including the build function).
pkgtools' pkgfile aims to be pkgutils' Pkgfile compatible with a sloppy dependency
handling.

pkgmk creates `contents` and `md6sum` in the package's root directory.
`contents` has contents of packages without root and `md5sum` has the md5sum
of files that is used by pkgmk in the build process.

 pkgadd
========

pkgadd extracts the tarball produced by pkgmk and installs it to / or a
custom root. this makes installing packages to home directory a lot easier.
